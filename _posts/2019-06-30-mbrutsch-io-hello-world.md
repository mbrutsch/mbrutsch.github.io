Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together.
Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts.
It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be, but only because I copied the steps exactly from <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">this link</a>
